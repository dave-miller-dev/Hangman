# Hangman

ABOUT:
A simple version of the classic boredom busting game, Hangman. Guess a word, letter by letter, in a limited number of attempts.

HOW TO RUN:
Run the .py file in your Terminal. Refer to OS for instructions.

OBJECTIVES:
This was the first application I ever programmed in my life. The learning objectives for this applicatin were using functions, loops, lists, and other variables. The Random module is a cherry on top.
Once I completed this application I was instantly hooked on the buzz of programming, having a problem and finding the solution to fix it.

ABOUT ME:
My name is Dave, I am 35 years old, currently learning to program with my first language, Python, whilst in COVID-19 lockdown in Melbourne, Australia. My intention is to become a software developer in 2021 and beyond. I'm interested in back-end software development, as well as native audio software development (based on interest from my previous work). I plan to learn C++ as my next language.

Thanks for playing!
